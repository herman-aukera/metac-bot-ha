# 🧪📄 Documentation-Test Alignment Protocol

## 🔍 Purpose

Ensure **every workflow and agent capability** is documented with:

1. **Input/output examples**
2. **Explanation of reasoning logic**
3. **Direct links to unit/integration tests**

All tests must trace back to a documented workflow or behavior.

## ✅ Minimum Requirements Per Feature

For **every new feature, tool, chain, or agent behavior**, the following must exist:

| Requirement         | File/Location                                |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Feature Doc         | `/docs/FEATURE_NAME.md`                      |
| Input/Output Sample | In the doc — JSON or CLI format              |
| Linked Test         | Link to `tests/` file + line #               |
| Explanation         | Description of reasoning or logic applied    |
| Forecast Schema     | Clearly defined output format                |
