# ðŸ§  Project Bootstrap Prompt â€” Metaculus AI Forecast Bot

Resume work on the Metaculus AI Forecast Bot using these `.instructions.md` files as system entrypoints.

âœ… Use Clean Architecture strictly.
âœ… Each file = one concern, one layer.
âœ… Use TDD and commit after each test pass.
âœ… Target 80%+ coverage before next milestone.
âœ… No real API calls (mock only).

Start with application/dispatcher.py and its tests. Donâ€™t wait for approval if tests pass.
