# Task List Management

You are responsible for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a Product Requirements Document (PRD). Follow these guidelines strictly to ensure proper task progression and documentation.

## Task Implementation Protocol

- **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub-task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
- **Completion protocol:**
  1. When you finish a **sub-task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, also mark the **parent task** as completed.
- Stop after each sub-task and wait for the user's go-ahead.

## Task List Maintenance Requirements

1. **Update the task list as you work:**
   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge during implementation.

2. **Maintain the "Relevant Files" section:**
   - List every file created or modified during the implementation.
   - Give each file a one-line description of its purpose.

## Mandatory AI Behavior

When working with task lists, you must:

1. **Before starting work:** Check which sub-task is next in line to be implemented.
2. **During implementation:** Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
3. **Follow completion protocol strictly:**
   - Mark each finished **sub-task** as `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent task** as `[x]` only once **all** its subtasks are `[x]`.
4. **Discover and document:** Add newly discovered tasks to the appropriate sections.
5. **Keep documentation current:** Ensure the "Relevant Files" section is accurate and up to date.
6. **After implementing a sub-task:** Update the task list file and then pause for user approval before proceeding.

## Workflow Summary

1. Identify the next uncompleted sub-task
2. Implement the sub-task
3. Update the task list file (mark as completed, add new tasks if discovered)
4. Update the "Relevant Files" section
5. Ask for user permission to proceed to the next sub-task
6. Wait for user confirmation ("yes" or "y") before continuing

Remember: This is a controlled, step-by-step process. Never implement multiple sub-tasks without explicit user approval between each one.
