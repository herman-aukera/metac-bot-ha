# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Forecasting Bot project has comprehensive high-level documentation but lacks feature-specific documentation that aligns with the Documentation-Test Alignment Protocol. This feature will create detailed documentation for each agent, tool, and workflow with input/output examples, reasoning explanations, and direct links to tests.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the forecasting bot, I want detailed documentation for each agent type, so that I can understand their specific capabilities, inputs, outputs, and test coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to understand an agent's behavior THEN I SHALL find a dedicated documentation file in `/docs/agents/` with complete specifications
2. WHEN I review agent documentation THEN I SHALL see input/output examples in JSON format
3. WHEN I examine agent documentation THEN I SHALL find direct links to corresponding test files with line numbers
4. WHEN I read agent documentation THEN I SHALL understand the reasoning logic and decision-making process

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with external APIs, I want comprehensive documentation for each API client, so that I can understand usage patterns, error handling, and fallback mechanisms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to use an API client THEN I SHALL find documentation in `/docs/apis/` with usage examples
2. WHEN I review API documentation THEN I SHALL see request/response schemas and error handling patterns
3. WHEN I examine API documentation THEN I SHALL find links to integration tests
4. WHEN I use API clients THEN I SHALL understand fallback mechanisms and quota management

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with domain services, I want detailed documentation for each service, so that I can understand their business logic, dependencies, and test coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to understand a domain service THEN I SHALL find documentation in `/docs/services/` with clear explanations
2. WHEN I review service documentation THEN I SHALL see method signatures, parameters, and return types
3. WHEN I examine service documentation THEN I SHALL find links to unit tests
4. WHEN I use domain services THEN I SHALL understand their role in the overall architecture

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with the forecasting pipeline, I want comprehensive workflow documentation, so that I can understand the complete forecasting process from question ingestion to prediction submission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to understand the forecasting workflow THEN I SHALL find documentation in `/docs/workflows/` with step-by-step explanations
2. WHEN I review workflow documentation THEN I SHALL see data flow diagrams and decision points
3. WHEN I examine workflow documentation THEN I SHALL find links to end-to-end tests
4. WHEN I trace a forecast THEN I SHALL understand each processing stage and its purpose

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer debugging the system, I want comprehensive troubleshooting documentation, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I encounter an error THEN I SHALL find troubleshooting guides in `/docs/troubleshooting/` with common solutions
2. WHEN I review troubleshooting documentation THEN I SHALL see error patterns, causes, and resolution steps
3. WHEN I examine troubleshooting documentation THEN I SHALL find links to relevant test cases
4. WHEN I debug issues THEN I SHALL have access to monitoring and logging guidance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a new developer joining the project, I want a comprehensive onboarding guide, so that I can quickly understand the system architecture and start contributing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start working on the project THEN I SHALL find an onboarding guide in `/docs/onboarding/` with setup instructions
2. WHEN I review onboarding documentation THEN I SHALL see architecture overview, key concepts, and development workflow
3. WHEN I examine onboarding documentation THEN I SHALL find links to getting started tests
4. WHEN I complete onboarding THEN I SHALL understand how to run tests, make changes, and deploy updates
