# Requirements Document - Production AI Forecasting Bot

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for completing the production-ready AI forecasting bot for the Metaculus AI Forecasting Benchmark. The system must achieve competitive performance in forecasting tournaments by leveraging advanced reasoning capabilities, tournament-specific strategies, and sophisticated forecasting techniques to maximize prediction accuracy and tournament ranking.

The system follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation between domain logic, application services, and infrastructure concerns. It implements Domain-Driven Design patterns and maintains high code quality standards with comprehensive testing coverage. The bot is designed to continuously learn and adapt throughout tournaments while maintaining proper risk management and calibration.
