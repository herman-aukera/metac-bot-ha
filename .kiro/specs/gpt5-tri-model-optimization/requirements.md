# Requirements Document - GPT-5 Tri-Model Optimization with Anti-Slop Directives

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for optimizing the existing tri-model GPT-5 system with enhanced anti-slop directives to maximize tournament performance within the $100 budget constraint. The system will implement a strategic cost-performance triangle using GPT-5 nano, mini, and full variants with sophisticated prompt engineering and quality guards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced GPT-5 Model Configuration

**User Story:** As a tournament competitor, I want to use the most cost-effective GPT-5 model variants so that I can process 2000+ questions within the $100 budget instead of only 300 with GPT-5 full.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL configure GPT-5 nano ($0.05/1M tokens), GPT-5 mini ($0.25/1M tokens), and GPT-5 full ($1.50/1M tokens) models
2. WHEN GPT-5 models are unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback gracefully to GPT-4 variants with equivalent functionality
3. WHEN model selection occurs THEN the system SHALL choose the optimal model based on task type, complexity, and budget remaining
4. WHEN budget utilization exceeds 95% THEN the system SHALL force GPT-5 nano usage for all tasks
5. WHEN budget utilization is between 50-95% THEN the system SHALL prefer cheaper models when task complexity allows

### Requirement 2: Advanced Anti-Slop Quality Guard System

**User Story:** As a forecasting expert, I want sophisticated anti-slop directives integrated into all prompts so that I can ensure clean, cited reasoning that prevents hallucinations and maintains tournament compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any prompt is generated THEN it SHALL include base anti-slop directives for quality assurance
2. WHEN research tasks are performed THEN the system SHALL require source citations for every factual claim
3. WHEN forecasting tasks are performed THEN the system SHALL include calibration and overconfidence reduction directives
4. WHEN responses are generated THEN the system SHALL validate evidence traceability and uncertainty acknowledgment
5. WHEN response length exceeds 300 words THEN the system SHALL apply automatic summarization unless complex analysis is required

### Requirement 3: Strategic Model Routing Optimization

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious competitor, I want intelligent model routing that maximizes forecast quality per dollar spent so that I can achieve optimal tournament performance within budget constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation or parsing tasks are needed THEN the system SHALL route to GPT-5 nano for ultra-fast processing
2. WHEN research synthesis is required THEN the system SHALL route to GPT-5 mini for balanced speed and intelligence
3. WHEN final forecasting decisions are needed THEN the system SHALL route to GPT-5 full for maximum reasoning power
4. WHEN content length is under 100 characters THEN the system SHALL automatically use GPT-5 nano regardless of task type
5. WHEN complexity is assessed as "high" AND budget allows THEN the system SHALL upgrade model tier appropriately

### Requirement 4: Multi-Stage Validation Pipeline

**User Story:** As a quality-focused forecaster, I want a multi-stage validation system so that I can prevent hallucinations and ensure all reasoning is evidence-based and tournament-compliant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN research is conducted THEN GPT-5 mini SHALL gather information with mandatory source citations
2. WHEN research is completed THEN GPT-5 nano SHALL validate accuracy and flag potential hallucinations
3. WHEN forecasting is performed THEN GPT-5 full SHALL make final predictions with calibration checks
4. WHEN any response lacks citations THEN the system SHALL reject it and request revision
5. WHEN uncertainty is not acknowledged appropriately THEN the system SHALL append uncertainty qualifiers

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Prompt Engineering Templates

**User Story:** As a tournament participant, I want state-of-the-art prompt templates that incorporate the latest prompt engineering techniques so that I can maximize model performance and maintain competitive advantage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN research prompts are generated THEN they SHALL include structured output requirements and 48-hour news focus
2. WHEN binary forecasting prompts are created THEN they SHALL include scenario analysis, base rate consideration, and calibration instructions
3. WHEN multiple choice prompts are generated THEN they SHALL include probability distribution guidance and unexpected outcome consideration
4. WHEN numeric forecasting prompts are created THEN they SHALL include uncertainty quantification and wide confidence interval instructions
5. WHEN any prompt is created THEN it SHALL include tier-specific optimization based on the selected GPT-5 variant

### Requirement 6: Budget-Aware Operation Modes

**User Story:** As a budget-conscious competitor, I want automatic operation mode switching so that I can maintain functionality throughout the tournament without exceeding the $100 limit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN budget utilization is 0-50% THEN the system SHALL operate in normal mode with optimal model selection
2. WHEN budget utilization is 50-80% THEN the system SHALL operate in conservative mode with cost-preferred selections
3. WHEN budget utilization is 80-95% THEN the system SHALL operate in emergency mode with GPT-5 nano preference
4. WHEN budget utilization exceeds 95% THEN the system SHALL operate in critical mode with GPT-5 nano only
5. WHEN budget is exhausted THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to essential functions only

### Requirement 7: Tournament Compliance Integration

**User Story:** As a tournament participant, I want seamless integration with existing tournament systems so that I can maintain all compliance requirements while benefiting from enhanced performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system operates THEN it SHALL maintain compatibility with existing budget management systems
2. WHEN forecasts are generated THEN they SHALL comply with tournament transparency and reasoning comment requirements
3. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL maintain automated operation without human intervention
4. WHEN API failures occur THEN the system SHALL use intelligent fallback strategies without breaking tournament rules
5. WHEN the system completes tasks THEN it SHALL provide comprehensive cost and performance reporting

### Requirement 8: Performance Monitoring and Optimization

**User Story:** As a performance-focused competitor, I want detailed monitoring of model selection effectiveness so that I can continuously optimize my tournament strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model routing decisions are made THEN the system SHALL log the rationale and cost implications
2. WHEN tasks are completed THEN the system SHALL track actual vs estimated costs for calibration
3. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL analyze cost-effectiveness by model tier
4. WHEN optimization opportunities are identified THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations
5. WHEN tournament phases change THEN the system SHALL adapt routing strategies based on remaining budget and time
