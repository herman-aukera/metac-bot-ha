## Implementation Details

### Real-Time Cost and Performance Tracking

The system tracks:
- **Model Selection Decisions**: Which model was chosen and why
- **Execution Outcomes**: Actual cost, execution time, quality scores
- **Cost Efficiency**: Questions processed per dollar spent
- **Quality Metrics**: Success rates, fallback usage, execution times
- **Tournament Competitiveness**: Overall performance vs. budget utilization

### Analytics and Optimization

The analytics engine provides:
- **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**: Identifies most efficient model tiers and routing strategies
- **Performance Correlations**: Analyzes relationships between cost and quality
- **Tournament Phase Strategies**: Adapts recommendations based on budget utilization
- **Budget Optimization**: Suggests optimal allocation across model tiers
- **Trend Analysis**: Tracks performance changes over time

### Alert System

The monitoring system generates alerts for:
- **Performance Degradation**: Declining accuracy or quality scores
- **Cost Efficiency Issues**: Low questions-per-dollar ratios
- **Tournament Competitiveness**: Concerning performance levels
- **Budget Thresholds**: Critical budget utilization levels

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.infrastructure.monitoring.integrated_monitoring_service import IntegratedMonitoringService

# Initialize monitoring
monitoring = IntegratedMonitoringService()
monitoring.start_monitoring()

# Record model usage
monitoring.record_model_usage(
    question_id="q123",
    task_type="forecast",
    selected_model="openai/gpt-5",
    selected_tier="full",
    routing_rationale="Complex analysis required",
    estimated_cost=0.05,
    operation_mode="normal",
    budget_remaining=75.0
)

# Record execution outcome
monitoring.record_execution_outcome(
    question_id="q123",
    actual_cost=0.048,
    execution_time=45.5,
    quality_score=0.92,
    success=True,
    fallback_used=False
)

# Get comprehensive status
status = monitoring.get_comprehensive_status(100.0)
print(f"Overall Health: {status.overall_health}")
print(f"Budget Utilization: {status.tournament_competitiveness['budget_utilization_rate']:.1f}%")

# Generate strategic recommendations
recommendations = monitoring.generate_strategic_recommendations(25.0, 100.0)
print(f"Tournament Phase: {recommendations['tournament_phase_strategy']['phase']}")
```

### Advanced Analytics

```python
from src.infrastructure.monitoring.optimization_analytics import OptimizationAnalytics

analytics = OptimizationAnalytics()

# Analyze cost-effectiveness
cost_analysis = analytics.analyze_cost_effectiveness(24)
print(f"Overall Efficiency: {cost_analysis.overall_efficiency:.1f} questions/$")

# Analyze performance correlations
correlations = analytics.analyze_performance_correlations(24)
print(f"Cost-Quality Correlation: {correlations.cost_quality_correlation:.3f}")

# Generate tournament strategy
strategy = analytics.generate_tournament_phase_strategy(45.0, 100.0)
print(f"Recommended Allocation: {strategy.budget_allocation_strategy}")
```
