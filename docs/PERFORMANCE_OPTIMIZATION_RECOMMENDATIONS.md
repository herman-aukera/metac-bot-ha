# Performance Optimization Recommendations

## Tournament Strategy Overview

The Fall 2025 AI Benchmark Tournament requires balancing forecasting accuracy with strict budget constraints. These recommendations optimize for competitive performance within the $100 budget limit.

## Model Selection Strategy

### Tier 1: High-Value Questions (Use GPT-4o)
- Questions with long time horizons (>30 days)
- Complex economic or geopolitical topics
- Questions where accuracy significantly impacts ranking
- Final predictions before question resolution

**Budget Allocation:** 40-50% of total budget

### Tier 2: Standard Questions (Use GPT-4o-mini)
- Most research tasks
- Simple binary predictions
- Questions with short time horizons (<7 days)
- Routine forecasting updates

**Budget Allocation:** 45-55% of total budget

### Tier 3: Emergency Mode (GPT-4o-mini only)
- All tasks when budget >95% utilized
- Minimal research, focus on predictions only
- Critical questions only

**Budget Allocation:** 5-10% reserve
## Research Optimization

### Efficient Research Strategies

**48-Hour News Windows:**
- Focus on recent developments only
- Avoid redundant historical research
- Use structured news summaries
- Implement smart source prioritization

**Prompt Engineering:**
- Use concise, structured prompts
- Implement template-based research
- Optimize for token efficiency
- Cache frequently used information

**Research Depth Adaptation:**
- Simple questions: 1-2 research iterations
- Complex questions: 3-4 research iterations
- Emergency mode: 0-1 research iterations

### Cost-Effective Research Techniques

**Information Prioritization:**
1. Recent news and developments (highest priority)
2. Expert opinions and analysis
3. Historical context (lowest priority)
4. Statistical data and trends

**Source Optimization:**
- Prioritize high-quality, concise sources
- Use summarization for long articles
- Implement smart content filtering
- Avoid redundant information gathering
## Scheduling Optimization

### Tournament-Aware Scheduling

**Standard Period (Tournament Start to Mid-Point):**
- Forecast every 4 hours
- Focus on question discovery and initial predictions
- Build research database for future use
- Conservative budget utilization (target: 30-40%)

**Critical Period (Mid-Point to Final Month):**
- Forecast every 2 hours
- Increase research depth for high-value questions
- Optimize existing predictions
- Moderate budget utilization (target: 60-80%)

**Final Period (Last 24-48 Hours):**
- Forecast every hour
- Focus on final prediction refinements
- Emergency mode if budget critical
- Use remaining budget strategically

### Question Prioritization

**High Priority:**
- Questions closing soon with significant point value
- Questions where bot has competitive advantage
- Questions with recent relevant developments

**Medium Priority:**
- Standard tournament questions
- Questions with moderate time horizons
- Routine prediction updates

**Low Priority:**
- Questions closing far in future
- Questions with limited new information
- Questions where bot performance is poor
## Calibration and Accuracy Optimization

### Cost-Aware Calibration

**Overconfidence Reduction:**
- Implement systematic confidence adjustment
- Use community prediction anchoring
- Apply tournament-specific calibration
- Monitor and adjust based on performance

**Smart Uncertainty Quantification:**
- Use efficient uncertainty estimation methods
- Implement cost-effective ensemble techniques
- Balance accuracy with computational cost
- Optimize for log scoring performance

### Performance Monitoring

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Cost per log score point
- Accuracy vs. spending correlation
- Calibration improvement over time
- Competitive ranking vs. budget utilization

**Optimization Triggers:**
- Adjust strategy if cost-effectiveness drops
- Increase research depth if accuracy suffers
- Switch to emergency mode if budget critical
- Reallocate budget based on question performance

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### Adaptive Model Selection

**Complexity-Based Selection:**
- Analyze question complexity automatically
- Match model capability to question difficulty
- Use GPT-4o only when necessary
- Implement smart fallback strategies
**Performance-Based Adaptation:**
- Track model performance by question type
- Adjust selection based on success rates
- Implement learning from past predictions
- Optimize for tournament-specific patterns

### Budget Allocation Strategy

**Phase-Based Allocation:**
- Phase 1 (Months 1-2): 30% budget, focus on setup
- Phase 2 (Months 2-3): 50% budget, active forecasting
- Phase 3 (Final month): 20% budget, optimization

**Question-Type Allocation:**
- Economic questions: 40% (high accuracy potential)
- Political questions: 30% (moderate accuracy)
- Technology questions: 20% (specialized knowledge)
- Other questions: 10% (opportunistic)
