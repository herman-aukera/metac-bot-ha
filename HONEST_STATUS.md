# Honest Status Report - What Actually Works vs What Doesn't

**Date**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: ❌ SYSTEM NOT FUNCTIONAL

## Critical Findings

### ❌ Problem 1: Circuit Breaker Blocking Everything
```
consecutive_failures: 15 (threshold: 10)
is_open: true
time_until_reset: 1482 seconds (~25 minutes)
```

**Impact**: ALL OpenRouter API calls blocked for 1 hour after 15 consecutive rate limit errors.
**Root Cause**: OpenRouter has 10-second per-key rate limit. Bot hit this repeatedly.
**Evidence**: run_summary.json shows `"openrouter_total_retries": 12` before circuit breaker opened.

### ❌ Problem 2: Misleading Metrics
```json
"successful_forecasts": 12,  // ← Objects created, NOT published
"published_success": 0,      // ← Actually published count
"publish_attempts": 0        // ← Never tried to publish
```

**Impact**: Summary makes it look like 12 forecasts succeeded. Actually: 0 published.
**Root Cause**: Metrics track forecast object creation, not publication success.

### ❌ Problem 3: Zero Forecasts on Metaculus
**URL**: https://www.metaculus.com/tournament/fall-aib-2025/?forecaster_id=277765&status=open
**Expected**: 50-80 forecasts published
**Actual**: 0 forecasts visible
**Evidence**: User confirmed by checking website directly

### ❌ Problem 4: Code Changes Unverified
**Claim**: "Fixed publication guard"
**Reality**: Cannot verify - circuit breaker prevented any forecasts from being attempted
**Evidence**: `"publish_attempts": 0` in run_summary.json

## What I Assumed Wrong

1. ❌ Assumed publication guard was the only issue
2. ❌ Assumed rate limiting would be handled by retry logic
3. ❌ Assumed "successful_forecasts" meant published forecasts
4. ❌ Assumed code changes could be verified without checking circuit breaker state
5. ❌ Didn't check Metaculus website to verify zero publications

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Circuit Breaker Opened
1. OpenRouter rate limit: 10 seconds per key = max 6 requests/minute
2. Bot tries to process 93 questions rapidly
3. Each question needs multiple LLM calls (research + forecast)
4. Rate limit exceeded → 403 errors
5. After 15 consecutive 403s → circuit breaker opens
6. All subsequent calls blocked for 1 hour

### Why Rate Limiting Failed
```python
# Current retry logic (llm_client.py):
max_retries = 5
initial_backoff = 2.0  # exponential: 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s = 62s total

# OpenRouter rate limit:
10 seconds per key

# Problem:
# Retry happens quickly (62s total), but rate limit is 10s per request
# Multiple questions trying to forecast concurrently exceed rate limit
```

## What Needs to Happen Next

### 1. Fix Circuit Breaker Configuration
```python
# Current (too sensitive):
OPENROUTER_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD = 10  # Opens after 10 failures
OPENROUTER_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TIMEOUT = 3600  # Blocked for 1 hour

# Proposed (more resilient):
OPENROUTER_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD = 50  # More tolerance
OPENROUTER_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TIMEOUT = 300   # 5 minutes, not 1 hour
```

### 2. Add Per-Request Rate Limiting
```python
# Need to add between-request delays to respect 10s limit:
import asyncio

async def rate_limited_llm_call(llm, prompt):
    result = await llm.invoke(prompt)
    await asyncio.sleep(12)  # Wait 12s between requests (10s limit + 2s buffer)
    return result
```

### 3. Process Questions Serially, Not Concurrently
```python
# Current: Processes multiple questions concurrently
# Problem: Exceeds rate limit

# Fix: Process one at a time
for question in questions:
    await forecast_question(question)  # Serial, not parallel
```

### 4. Add Circuit Breaker Reset Command
```bash
# Allow manual reset for testing:
python3 -c "from src.infrastructure.external_apis.llm_client import reset_openrouter_circuit_breaker; reset_openrouter_circuit_breaker()"
```

### 5. Fix Test Script Method Name
```python
# WRONG:
questions = MetaculusApi.get_all_questions_from_tournament(...)

# CORRECT:
questions = MetaculusApi.get_all_open_questions_from_tournament(...)
```

### 6. Fix Summary Metrics
```python
# Current: Counts forecast objects created
"successful_forecasts": len(published_like_reports)

# Should be: Count actual Metaculus publications
"successful_forecasts": published_success  # Use this metric instead
```

## Validation Checklist (Before Claiming Anything Works)

- [ ] Circuit breaker reset or expired
- [ ] Rate limiting strategy added (12s delays)
- [ ] Test script method name fixed
- [ ] Run on single question first: `python3 test_single_forecast.py`
- [ ] Verify forecast appears on Metaculus website
- [ ] Check run_summary.json: `"published_success" > 0`
- [ ] Verify circuit breaker stayed closed: `"is_open": false`
- [ ] Only THEN run full tournament

## Confidence Assessment

- **Confidence in current system**: ❌ ZERO - Circuit breaker blocked everything
- **Confidence in code changes**: ❓ UNKNOWN - Never got tested due to circuit breaker
- **Confidence in rate limiting fix**: ❌ NOT FIXED - Needs 12s delays added
- **Confidence in metrics**: ❌ MISLEADING - Tracks wrong thing

## Next Action

**DO NOT RUN FULL TOURNAMENT YET**

1. Fix test script
2. Reset circuit breaker OR wait 25 minutes
3. Add 12-second delays between LLM calls
4. Test on ONE question
5. Verify on Metaculus website
6. Then consider full run

---

**Bottom Line**: I made assumptions without checking circuit breaker state, rate limiting behavior, or Metaculus website. The system is NOT functional. Need rate limiting fix before any forecasts will publish.
