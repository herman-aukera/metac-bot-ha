# Circuit Breaker Implementation - Summary

## ✅ Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: Bot was running continuously for ~24 hours without stopping due to infinite retry loops when OpenRouter API quota was exhausted (403 "Key limit exceeded" errors).

**Root Cause**: Exponential backoff retry logic had no circuit breaker pattern - each API call would retry up to 5 times, but there was no global protection against quota exhaustion cascade failures.

**User's Request**: "tu deberias de poner un limite de reintentos despues del backoff incremental" (you should put a retry limit after the incremental backoff).

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- **Failure Threshold**: Opens after 10 consecutive quota failures
- **Timeout Period**: Stays open for 1 hour (3600 seconds)
- **Auto-Reset**: Automatically closes after timeout period
- **Manual Reset**: Can be manually reset for emergencies

### Key Components

#### 1. LLM Client Circuit Breaker (`src/infrastructure/external_apis/llm_client.py`)
```python
# Global circuit breaker state
OPENROUTER_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_OPEN = False
OPENROUTER_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_OPENED_AT = 0.0
OPENROUTER_CONSECUTIVE_QUOTA_FAILURES = 0
OPENROUTER_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD = 10
OPENROUTER_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TIMEOUT = 3600
```

#### 2. Main Execution Check (`main.py`)
- Checks circuit breaker before starting tournament
- Includes circuit breaker status in run summary
- Skips execution if circuit breaker is open

#### 3. Utility Functions
- `is_openrouter_circuit_breaker_open()`: Check if circuit breaker is open
- `get_openrouter_circuit_breaker_status()`: Get detailed status information
- `reset_openrouter_circuit_breaker()`: Manual reset for emergencies

## ✅ Verification Tests

### 1. Circuit Breaker Logic Test
```bash
python3 scripts/simulate_circuit_breaker.py
```
- ✅ Opens after exactly 10 consecutive failures
- ✅ Blocks subsequent requests for 1 hour
- ✅ Manual reset works correctly
- ✅ Status reporting functions work

### 2. Integration Test
```bash
python3 scripts/test_main_integration.py
```
- ✅ main.py correctly checks circuit breaker before running
- ✅ Status information included in run_summary.json
- ✅ Circuit breaker prevents execution when open

### 3. Real Environment Test
```bash
DRY_RUN=true SKIP_PREVIOUSLY_FORECASTED=true python3 main.py --mode tournament
```
- ✅ Bot completed 96 questions successfully
- ✅ Circuit breaker status correctly reported in run_summary.json
- ✅ No infinite loops during normal operation

## ✅ Production Safety Features

### Prevents Infinite Loops
- Global failure tracking across all API calls
- Circuit breaker opens after consecutive quota failures
- Blocks execution for 1 hour timeout period

### Monitoring & Observability
- Circuit breaker status in run_summary.json
- Detailed logging of quota failures and circuit breaker events
- Manual reset capability for emergency situations

### Graceful Degradation
- Bot continues processing other questions when possible
- Circuit breaker only affects OpenRouter API calls
- Other components (AskNews, Wikipedia) continue working

## ✅ Example Output

Circuit breaker activated in run_summary.json:
```json
{
  "openrouter_circuit_breaker": {
    "is_open": true,
    "consecutive_failures": 15,
    "failure_threshold": 10,
    "opened_at": 1759328026.372512,
    "timeout_seconds": 3600,
    "time_until_reset_seconds": 1653.7
  }
}
```

## ✅ Next Steps

1. **Monitor Production**: Watch for circuit breaker activations in logs
2. **Adjust Thresholds**: Fine-tune failure threshold and timeout if needed
3. **Alert Integration**: Consider adding alerts when circuit breaker opens
4. **Documentation**: Update deployment docs with circuit breaker information

---

## Confidence: High

**Implementation**: Complete circuit breaker pattern with proper state management, integration with main execution flow, and comprehensive testing.

**Verification**: Multiple test scenarios confirm correct behavior under quota exhaustion conditions.

**Production Ready**: Safe for deployment with monitoring and manual override capabilities.

**User Request Fulfilled**: "limite de reintentos despues del backoff incremental" ✅ implemented through circuit breaker pattern that prevents infinite retries after quota exhaustion.
