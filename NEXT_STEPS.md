# IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN - Fix Circuit Breaker & Test

## Current Situation (Facts Only)

✅ **Verified Facts:**
- Circuit breaker is OPEN with 15 consecutive failures
- `"published_success": 0` - Zero forecasts published to Metaculus
- `"publish_attempts": 0` - Never attempted to publish
- OpenRouter rate limit: 10 seconds per key
- Account balance: $143.68 remaining
- User confirmed zero forecasts visible on Metaculus website

❌ **What Doesn't Work:**
- Rate limiting strategy insufficient for 10s per-key limit
- Circuit breaker too sensitive (threshold: 10, timeout: 1 hour)
- Metrics track forecast generation, not publication
- Test script had wrong method name

## Step-by-Step Fix (No Assumptions)

### Step 1: Reset Circuit Breaker

```bash
python3 reset_circuit_breaker.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Circuit breaker is OPEN. Resetting...
✅ Circuit breaker manually reset
New Status:
  is_open: False
  consecutive_failures: 0
```

### Step 2: Test Single Question (Verify End-to-End)

```bash
python3 test_single_forecast.py
```

**What This Will Show:**
- Whether API keys work
- Whether rate limiting is respected
- Whether forecast publishes to Metaculus
- Whether circuit breaker stays closed

### Step 3: Check Metaculus Website

After Step 2, manually verify:
<https://www.metaculus.com/tournament/fall-aib-2025/?forecaster_id=277765&status=open>

**Look for:**
- At least 1 new forecast visible
- Your username on the forecast
- Timestamp matches test run time

### Step 4: If Test Works, Identify Root Cause

**Possible Outcomes:**

**A) Test succeeds** → Original run hit rate limit too fast
**Fix:** Add delays between questions

**B) Test fails with 403** → Rate limiting still not working
**Fix:** Increase delays OR use free tier models

**C) Test fails with other error** → Different issue
**Fix:** Read actual error message

## What I Will NOT Do Anymore

- ❌ Assume code changes work without verification
- ❌ Trust metrics without checking Metaculus website
- ❌ Ignore circuit breaker state
- ❌ Claim fixes without evidence
- ❌ Make assumptions about API behavior

## What I Will Do

- ✅ Check circuit breaker state FIRST
- ✅ Verify on Metaculus website
- ✅ Read actual error messages
- ✅ Test on single question before full run
- ✅ Provide evidence for every claim

## Next: Run These Commands

```bash
# 1. Reset circuit breaker
python3 reset_circuit_breaker.py

# 2. Test single forecast
python3 test_single_forecast.py

# 3. Check website (manual)
# URL: https://www.metaculus.com/tournament/fall-aib-2025/?forecaster_id=277765&status=open
```

Then tell me what you see - the actual terminal output and whether the forecast appeared on Metaculus.
